# graduate_research_citco

A repository summarizing one of my main research projects in grad school: Stereoisomerization of human constitutive androstane receptor agonist CITCO.

All data is collected here. Main manuscript and supplementary materials are provided. I will soon provide Jupyter notebooks with the data treatment used to
generate the figures (not the same we used in the paper. For the actual paper we used GraphPad Prism, which is propietary. In the interests of commiting to
open source and open data standards, I will re-generate the main figures soon using Python through Jupyter notebooks.)

For a detailed explanation on this research employing everyday language, I will soon create a post on my blog (bmdiethelmv.wordpress.com.)
